# caecrack

caecrack is a small project I developed to get more familiar with rust. It is an automatic ROT solver. It uses a pre-defined wordlist to start cracking against a specific string or word.

This program is intended to tell you the number of rotations rather than tell you the plaintext string. To do this, it takes the first word of a sentence and solves that before everything else.
